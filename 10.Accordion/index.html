                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It structures
                    content on the web by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML
                    provides the basic building blocks for any web page and is complemented by CSS and JavaScript to
                    create dynamic, styled, and interactive websites.</p>

                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                    document written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a
                    web page. CSS allows developers to create visually appealing web pages and enables responsive
                    design, ensuring that websites look good on various devices and screen sizes.</p>

                <p> JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that powers the dynamic behavior on most
                    websites. It allows developers to create interactive elements like sliders, forms, and animations.
                    JavaScript can be used on both the client-side (in the browser) and server-side (with Node.js),
                    making it a key technology for full-stack development.</p>

                <p>TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types. It is designed
                    to catch errors early through type checking and to enhance code readability and maintainability.
                    TypeScript compiles down to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with any environment that runs
                    JavaScript, while providing additional tools and features for larger, complex projects.</p>

                    designs without writing traditional CSS. It encourages a design system where you can apply styles
                    directly in the HTML structure, leading to more efficient and scalable styling. Tailwind is popular
                    for its flexibility and the ability to create responsive designs quickly.</p>
